# Code-Quiz

Created a code quiz- more like pun quiz!

To play, click here: https://julieritz.github.io/Code-Quiz/

The quiz starts by showing a "start" screen with instructions on how to play.

The user then answers the questions, selecting the right or wrong answers.

If the answer is right they get 20 points, and if the answer is wrong they get no points and a deduction of 10 seconds from the clock. The game either ends when the questions are all completed or the clock reaches 0.

The user can then enter their score, which stores to local storage, and clear it if they wish.
